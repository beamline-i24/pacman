PACMAN
Notes
    Use ./pacman.py in the dls_sw scritps directory. It is the latest version. You should be able to run all your work while leaving it in that directory. Please do not edit it. It will save all your images to /dls_sw/i24/scripts/pacman-pictures/.  I am working on the directory method (dir=) so that currently isn’t as nice to use. You can try it an give me feedback.
EXAMPLES
./pacman.py file=/dls_sw/i24/scripts/darren/pacman/egbert_spots.out
./pacman.py file=/dls_sw/i24/scripts/darren/pacman/egbert_spots.out col=1 bind=shot xlim=0,25 cmap=PuOr dpi=600
./pacman-oxford13.py file=/dls/i24/data/2018/nt14493-94/processing/scripts/new_stat_scripts/unit_cell_counter/pacman_unit_cells_4.dat save=True num_of_doses=20 dose=0
KEYWORDS
file - target file destination and type
file=/complete/path/to/file/filename.out - this should be one of the spots.out files
file=/complete/path/to/file/filename.txt - this will treat it as a detector distance file (D.Axford)
file=/complete/path/to/file/filename.dat - this is a two colume file where the first column is image number and second is some value. Should be seperated my white space preferably with no header or extra line
dir - not yet fully working but worth trying, I think it only does int-0 but you’d have to check
dir=/your/directory/where/ints/are/
int_choice … this isn’t functional yet should be quick upgrade
col - Column choice from target file (works on .out, not tested on .dat or .txt)
.out
col=0 image num (not currently available to plot)
col=1  #spots
col=2  #spots_no_ice
col=3  total_intensity
col=4  d_min
col=5  d_min (distl method 1)
col=6  d_min (distl method 2)
col=7  #indexed
col=8  fraction_indexed
.txt
.dat
bind - This binds the image number either to i24/SACLA shot order. If for some reason you have collected in alphanumeric order (Miller group)
bind=shot (shot order)
bind=alpha (alphanumeric)
chip - Chip type describes the chip used. Useful for older data.
chiptype=0 (Toronto the originals 11664)
chiptype=1 (Oxford 25600) - this is the default
chiptype=2 (Hamburg)
chiptype=3 (Regina)
(update this to scantype in the future so that we can take gridscans)
blocks - This allows you to select specific blocks, its a little trickier as you must get the order correct.
blocks=A1,A2,B5,B6 (order must be same as shot order)
you can use the bind=shot to see the shot order pacman thinks you are using
num_of_doses (tested on dat files not on dir or .out)
num_of_dose=20 - must be an integer
dose (tested on dat files not on dir or .out)
dose=0 [1,2,3,...,(num_of_doses-1)]
dose=all [not yet functional]

Plotting
ms 
marker size default=8 (pixels)
cmap
https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html
Sequential:                  PuOr,  summer, Greys
Divergent:                    seismic
Perceptually uniform: viridis
Misc:                           terrain
xlim, ylim and zlim - these cut the plot
xlim=0,25
yllim=0,25
zlim=0,500000
              Future upgrade
zlim=200000,inf  (this will be the lower limit)
zlim=200000,      (this will be the lower limit)
zlim=200000       (this will be the lower limit)
zlim=,5000          (this will be the upper limit)
bracket - bracket cuts out data not within the bracket, its different from zlim in that it doesn’t set the scale. It can be used in combination with zlim if you want to view data within the bracket on a scale larger than the bracket. Outlier elimination.
bracket=[3,30]
dpi
dpi=200 (default)
dpi=600 (good for presentations but slower)
alpha
alpha=1.0  Opaque
alpha=0.0  Transparent
figsize=(10,10) this is in inches!
save = True
This is saved in  /dls_sw/i24/scripts/pacman-pictures/
ex: pacman_unit_cells_4_dose19_of_20_20180212_073017map.png
title … not done yet should be easy
cb … colorbar = True/Flase not done yet should be easy
all other plotting variants

A directory if a file has ‘int’ in the name in the directory then it’ll plot a binary map
